# Employee Scheduling App

# Description
The Employee Scheduling App is a web application designed for businesses to manage employee shifts. The main functionalities of the application include:

Employee Management: Enables managers to view all registered employees.
Shift Management: Allows managers to add, view, edit, and delete shifts for employees.
Coverage Request: Employees can request coverage for their shifts.
Coverage Approval: Managers can approve or decline the coverage request.
Covering Shifts: Other employees can take up shifts that need coverage.
The front-end of the application is built using React and the back-end is developed using Django Rest Framework. The app uses token-based authentication with the help of Django's Djoser library.
